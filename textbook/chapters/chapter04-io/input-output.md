# Different Ways to Do Input and Output in C++

We will cover three different ways to do input and output in C++: standard I/O, file I/O, and string I/O streams. We will also demonstrate how to detect and handle input errors in a program.

In this section, we will cover the standard and file input and output streams in C++.

## Standard Input and Output Streams

C++ provides standard input and output streams for reading from the keyboard and writing to the console. The standard input stream is represented by the `cin` object, while the standard output stream is represented by the `cout` object. Both `cin` and `cout` are part of the `iostream` library, which is included in C++ programs using the following directive:

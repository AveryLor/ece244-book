# Khufu: Object-Oriented Programming using C++

Welcome to the first edition of *Khufu: Object-Oriented Programming using C++* book. This textbook is a successor of [*Snefru: Learning Programming with C*](https://www.learningc.org)

This textbook is tailored for students taking ECE 244: Programming Fundamentals at the University of Toronto. It teaches foundations of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C++ programming language. It can serve as a resource for students who had prior programming experience in C (or C++). Students who know Python may struggle reading this textbook as we do not *thoroughly* discuss the C programming language. 

**Authors:** This book is based on course notes generated by Salma Emara, Tarek Abdelrahman, Ding Yuan and Michael Stumm. Together they created years of intellectual contributions to the course content. The primary author of this textbook is Salma Emara, who used the course notes as a starting point and then wrote this textbook from scratch. The textbook is currently maintained by Salma Emara.

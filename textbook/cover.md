# Khufu: Object-Oriented Programming using C++

Welcome to the first edition of *Khufu: Object-Oriented Programming using C++* book. This textbook is a successor of *Snefru: Learning Programming with C*.

This textbook is tailored for students taking ECE 244: Programming Fundamentals at the University of Toronto. It teaches foundations of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C++ programming language. It can serve as a resource for students who had prior programming experience in C (or C++). Students who know Python may struggle reading this textbook as we do not *thoroughly* discuss the C programming language.

Write down the standard output of the following program. Remember to write two "Check Point", since partial marks are given based on these "stop points". You might find it helpful to write down the memory layout.

```{code-block} cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int i[5] = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8};
int* p;

void foo() {
  cout << *p << endl;
  ++(*p);
  ++p;
}

void bar() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
    foo();
  }
}

int main() {
  p = i;
  bar();
  cout << "Check Point 1" << endl;
  p = i;
  foo();
  cout << "Check Point 2" << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
'''

answer = '''
0
2
4
Check Point 1
1
Check Point 2

Consider the following code snippet that manipulates pointers in a main function of a C++ program. 

```{code-block} cpp
int* p = nullptr;
int* q = nullptr;
int* r = nullptr;
int** t = &p;
int** s = &q;
r = p;
p = new int;
q = new int;
*p = 5;
*q = 2;
**s = *p + **t;
```

Which of the following statements (that come after the above snippets executes) prints 5 to the standard output? You may assume `iostream` is included and the `std` namespace is used. Choose all correct answers.

'''

answer = [3,4,7]

choices = [
  "(1) `cout << r;`",
  "(2) `cout << *t;`",
  "(3) `cout << *q;`",
  "(4) `cout << *p;`",
  "(5) `cout << **t;`",
  "(6) `cout << *r;`",
  "(7) `cout << *s;`",
  "(8) `cout << (**s) / 2;`"

explanation = '''
(4) `cout << *p;`

(5) `cout << **t;`

(8) `cout << (**s) / 2;` '''

Consider the following `main` function. The line numbers to the left are for reference and are not part of the code.

(2) The program may have a problem with it. What is the problem, if any? Circle only one answer.
'''

answer = [5]

choices = [
  "(1) The program has no problem with it",
  "(2) The program has a memory leak.",
  "(3) The delete on line 17 should not dereference p_ptr, but use it directly.",
  "(4) The program deletes the same region of memory more than once.",
  "(5) 2 and 3.",
  "(6) 2 and 4.",
  "(7) 2, 3 and 4.",

explanation = '''
The program has a memory leak because in line 13, it changes what `second_ptr` is pointing 
to without freeing up the memory space it was pointing to.`second_ptr`, `first_ptr`, and `*p_ptr` 
are all pointing to an `int` with 4, while there are three deletes for the same memory space.'''

Assuming the C++ compiler does not optimize away copying of objects. Write the output produced by the program.
'''

answer = '''
(3,4)
'''

explanation = '''
<pre>
(3,4)
</pre>
Recall, `this` is a pointer to the object itself. 


`a.increment_x()` is evaluated first, and would increment the `x` of object `a` making `x` of `a` equal to 3. This would return a new object with `x = 3` and `y = 3`. On this new object, you would call `increment_y()`, which would increment `y` to 4 and return a new object with `x = 3` and `y = 4`. Printing this new object would produce `(3,4)`.
<pre>
(3,3)
</pre>
Printing object `a` would output `(3,3)` due to the previous `a.increment_x()` call.

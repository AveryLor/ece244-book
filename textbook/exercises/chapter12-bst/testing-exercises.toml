Consider the following binary tree. The keys of the nodes are shown below inside the nodes.

(1) What is the *preorder* traversal of the tree?

1 2 3 4 5 6 7

**(NLR)** Nodes are visited recursively printing root node, left subtree then right subtree. This means when you print the left subtree, print it also by starting with the root, left node, then right node.

question = """
A binary tree is symmetric if the root node's left subtree is exactly a mirror reflection of the right subtree. For example, the tree on the left is symmetric, but the tree on the right is not.

```{figure} _images/not-symmetric-tree.png
```

Now, you are asked to complete the function `is_symmetric`. It should return `true` if and only if the root is a symmetric tree. You should fill out the **recursive** helper function
`is_symmetric_helper` to make `is_symmetric` work as expected. Hint: you should write less than 15 lines of code.
